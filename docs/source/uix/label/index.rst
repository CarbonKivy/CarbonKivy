    Carbon Design Labels Overview

The :class:`~kivy.uix.label.Label` widget is used to display non-editable text in a Kivy application. It is primarily employed for presenting static content such as titles, descriptions, instructions, messages, and status indicators throughout the user interface.

The :class:`~carbonkivy.uix.label.label.CLabel` class extends the functionality of :class:`~kivy.uix.label.Label` by introducing additional properties aligned with the Carbon Design System. These enhancements enable consistent typography, styling, and sizing based on the **IBM Plex** typeface, ensuring a cohesive and modern visual experience.
